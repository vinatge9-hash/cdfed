## Setup Instructions

To set up the Brewed Awakenings Coffee Shop website on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/brewed-awakenings-coffee-shop.git
   cd brewed-awakenings-coffee-shop
   ```

2. **Open the HTML Files:**
   You can open the HTML files in any web browser. Simply double-click on `index.html`, and it will open in your default browser.

3. **Edit and Customize:**
   You can customize the content by editing the HTML files directly. Use any text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).

4. **View Changes:**
   After making changes, refresh the browser to see the updates.

## Customization Guide

### Changing the Content

To change the content displayed on the website:

- **Homepage (index.html):** Edit the text and images within the `<body>` section to update the welcome message and featured items.
  
- **Menu (menu.html):** Modify the list of menu items, prices, and descriptions in the `<ul>` or `<table>` elements.

- **About Us (about us.html):** Update the content to reflect the history, mission, and values of Brewed Awakenings.

- **Location & Hours (location & hours.html):** Change the address and operating hours as necessary.

- **Contact Us (contact us.html):** Update the contact form fields and any additional information you want to provide.

### Styling Adjustments

If you wish to change the styling of the website:

1. **CSS File:** Create a separate CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and link it in the `<head>` section of each HTML file.
2. **Inline Styles:** You can also add inline styles directly within the HTML elements, but this is not recommended for maintainability.

### Adding New Pages

To add new pages to the website:

1. Create a new HTML file in the project root directory (e.g., `newpage.html`).
2. Add the necessary HTML structure to the new file.
3. Link the new page from the navigation menu in each existing HTML file.

## Component Documentation

### Navigation Bar

Each page includes a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the website. It typically contains links to:

- Home
- Menu
- About Us
- Location & Hours
- Contact Us

To modify the navigation links, locate the `<nav>` element in each HTML file and update the `<a>` tags.

### Footer

The footer section is included in all HTML files at the bottom. It may contain copyright information and links to social media profiles. Customize the footer by editing the content within the `<footer>` tag.

### Contact Form

The contact form on the `contact us.html` page allows customers to send inquiries. The form includes fields for name, email, and message. To handle form submissions, you may need to integrate a backend service or use a third-party form handler.

### Images

Images used on the website should be stored in an `/images` directory. You can add images by referencing them in the `<img>` tags throughout the HTML files.

### JavaScript Integration

If you wish to add interactive features, you can include JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of each HTML file. For example:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

You can then create a `script.js` file for any custom JavaScript functionality.
